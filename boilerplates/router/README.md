# Router Tablao App

A light web application boilerplate based on on the historyAPI and the hash url to handle state modifications. 

With two dependencies, **navigo** for the router and **mustache** for the templates, the proposed framework relay on the *MVC* pattern; with the router rolling the controller role, and the views rolling an hybrid role that aggregates responsabilities of the *MV* components of the *MVC* especification. It's designed to be little imperative, non-blackbox, and with broad delegation on the developer, who is the responsible of the biggest part when structure code.

### API

#### BaseView

The **BaseView** is the blueprint of all the application views/components. On top of prototypes, the static method `extend` leads to an easy, pseudo class inheritance, way to extend this blueprint to create new views with reutilization.
```javascript
new BaseView(el: HTMLNode, template: string);
```

**extend**
```javascript
BaseView.extend(view: function);
```
This method is a static method, not to be inherit on the child views, and allow to extend new views with the BaseView attributes. It waits for an view function as an input parametter.

```javascript
// Example about how to extend a new View prototype from the BaseView prototype.
const View = BaseView.extend(function (el, template) {
    // Do something on the initialization
});

View.prototype.onRender = function () {
    // Do something on render
}

View.prototype.customMethod = function () {
    // Do something
}
```

**render**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.render();
```
Call this method to fire the injection process of the view inside its root *el*.

**remove**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.remove();
```
Call this method to fire the dettach process of the view from its root *el*. When the view was removed, it perform an unbinding of all its listeners initialized with the method **on**.

**on**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.on(event: string, callback: function);
```
Bind a custom event to the view with a callback function to be executed each time the event is dispatched.

**off**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.off(event: string);
```
Remove an existing bind between arraound an event on the view.

**dispatch**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.dispatch(event: string, [data: object]);
```
Manual dispatching of a custom event.

**load**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.load(url: string, [type: string], [data: string]);
```
Load performs an ajax request.

##### To overwrite on inheritance
The following methods are designed to be overwriten on the inheritane moment and allow structured access to the view lifecycle.

**onRender**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.onRender();
```

**beforeRender**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.beforeRender();
```

**onUpdate**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.onUpdate();
```

**beforeUpdate**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.beforeUpdate();
```

**onRemove**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.onRemove();
```

**beforeRemove**
```javascript
BaseView.prototype.beforeRemove();
```
